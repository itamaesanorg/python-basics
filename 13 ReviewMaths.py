# Lets review some maths

# On python to:

# On python to sum two numbers: `a + b`
# On python to multiply two numbers: `a * b`
# On python to divide two numbers: `a / b`
# On python to subtract two numbers: `a - b`
# On python to find the remainder of two numbers: `a % b`
# On python to find the power of two numbers: `a ** b`
# On python to find the square root of a number: `sqrt(a)`
# On python to find the absolute value of a number: `abs(a)`
# On python to find the largest number of two numbers: `max(a, b)`
# On python to find the smallest number of two numbers: `min(a, b)`
# On python to find the largest number of three numbers: `max(a, b, c)`
# On python to find the smallest number of three numbers: `min(a, b, c)`

# So lets do some basic maths in python.

#Let's build robot barista!!!

print("Hello, and welcome to the ITAMEASAN Cofe shop!!!!!!")

# print("Waht is your name")

name = input("Waht is your name? \n")

print("Hello " + name+"," + " Thank you so much for coming to our shop. \n\n")
