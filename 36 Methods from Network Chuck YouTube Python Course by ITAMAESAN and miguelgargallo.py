# Let's go with Methods!
# Methods are functions that belong to a class, in Python we use the dot operator to access them.
# Methods in Python are defined with the def keyword and also have a return statement, but they are not required to have a return statement, cause they can return None, but also they can return any value.
# By append we add an item to the end of the list.

# supplies = ["towel", "sunblock", "sunscreen", "hat", "sunglasses", "swimsuit", "iPhone", "homekeys", "wallet", "ehternet cable", "gaming laptop", "camera", "gameboy-color", "batteries", "water battle", "time capsule", "marshmallows", "beer", "wine", "snacks", "burguers"]

# camp_site = ["Crystal Lake", 404, 89.3, True]

# supplies.append("toilet paper")

# Method 1
# supplies.append("bidet")

# print(supplies)

# Method 2

# append.extend(["toilet paper", "bidet"])
